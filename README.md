Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful approach to train artificial intelligence (AI) 
agents in various tasks, including playing video games. 
In this project, we focus on training an AI to play the classic game "Snake" using RL techniques. 
The goal is to develop an AI agent that can learn and improve its performance in the game by interacting with the game environment 
and receiving rewards based on its actions. 
The Snake game presents a challenging environment for RL because the agent needs to learn to navigate through the game board, 
collect food to grow, and avoid collisions with its own tail and the walls. We employ a variant of Deep Q-Network (DQN), 
a popular RL algorithm, to train the AI agent.
